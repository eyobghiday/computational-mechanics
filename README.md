# Computational Mechanics
This is a collection of projects & assignments for I worked Computational Mechanics. It explores the use of numerical methods to solve engineering problems in solid mechanics, fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Topics include matrix algebra, nonlinear equations of one variable, systems of linear algebraic equations, nonlinear equations of several variables, classification of partial differential equations in engineering, the finite difference method, and the finite element method.Computational Mechanics is solving engineering problems using codes & programs. The language used here is Python, but it can be Java, Javascript or Matlab as well. 

Topics covered are 3D Graphs, Eigen values & Matrices, Frequencies, Audio, Video and Signal processing. 

The assignments with their respective files are put in one folder.  Tools needed are anaconda, python, Jupyter Notebook, and/or spiderweb.

Read the assignment question first.
If there's a data sheet to be used (usually a csv file) download it and make sure to import it in your notebook code.
Understand the question and try the codes. 
Good day.
