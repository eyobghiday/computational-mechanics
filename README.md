# computational-mechanics
This is a collection of assignments I worked for a Fall 2020 class.
Computational Mechanics is solving engineering problems using codes & programs. The language used here is Python, but it can be Java, Javascript or Matlab as well. 

Topics covered are 3D Graphs, Eigen vlaues & matrices, Frequencies, Audio and Vidual processing. 
The assignments with their respective files are put in one folder. 
Tools needed are anaconda, python, jupyter notbook, and/or spiderweb.

Read the assignment question first.
If there's a data sheet to be used (usually a csv file) download it and make sure to import it in your notebook code.
Understand the question and try the codes. 
Good day.
